# Dodge
A simple dodging game controlled by the mouse made for the Netlogo Final Project of Intro to CS

## About
Various obstacles are sent toward the player which must be dodged. These obstacles include:
* Fish
* Fishbowls, which may explode into multiple fish
* Jellyfish, which spawn fish at its location periodically

The player may spawn arrows to destroy these obstacles if needed. Additionally items may be collected (orange patch) to spawn a wave of arrows around the player.

Green patches will increase the player's base speed.

The longer you can last without dying, the more money you earn, which can be spent on items, cosmetics, and improving stats.

## How to Use
To use the model open `dodge.nlogo` and press setup twice. Then press play. The rest of the game is controlled by the mouse (the player will move towards the cursor). 
If the user presses play before pressing setup twice, the game will crash and the user must type ‘ca’ into the console and restart.

## Bugs
* Additional items and arrows will not be credited at the start of each round
